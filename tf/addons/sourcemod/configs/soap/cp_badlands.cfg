//Badlands spawns arranged and modified by JaguarFiend, 9-2020.
//This layout is primarily based on type 1 or 2 (the H layout doesn't quite fit this map's layout) but

//These spawns are better than the totally random non-team ones since here there will be less enemies spawning perfectly behind you.
